### BGP(Border Gateway protocol)

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a type of external routing protocol that is primarily used for exchanging routing information between different Autonomous Systems (AS) on the Internet. It is a path vector protocol that is designed to support large and complex networks.

BGP is classified as an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) because it is used to exchange routing information between different ASes, as opposed to Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) like OSPF or EIGRP, which are used to exchange routing information within the same AS.

BGP is typically used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to establish connectivity with other networks and exchange routing information to enable end-to-end data transfer across the Internet. It is also used by large organizations with complex network topologies to exchange routing information between different locations or data centers.

Overall, BGP is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure and plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliable and efficient routing of traffic across the global network.

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a dynamic routing protocol, as opposed to a link-state protocol.
